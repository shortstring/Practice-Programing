#  Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
# before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
# to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the
# "right partition"; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.
# EXAMPLE
# Input:
# Output:
# 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 5 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition= 5]
# 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8
# Hints: #3, #24
